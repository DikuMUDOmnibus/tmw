#HELPS

1 CLAN~
1. You must level 20 to join a clan.

2. IF you join a clan you are expected to RP that clans ethos and beliefs.
Crying insult to settle differences is perfectly acceptable, and you may
draw blood. Only as long as you are clanned this is acceptable.

3. Do NOT join any clan until you investigate ALL clans, do this by
talking to the clan leaders (type clan list for a list of clan leaders).
If you don't find a clan you wish to join, consider starting a new one,
see HELP CLAN and HELP PRICES 

4. Once you join a clan, you are expected STAY WITH THAT Clan. No switching
clans, abandoning your clan mates, etc.; the point of joining a clan is to
use TEAMWORK. That means when you get pkilled, you ask your CLAN MATES to
retrieve your corpse, re-equip you, help you avenge your death, etc. Do
not count on the IMMs for help. 

5. Clanned characters are *not* allowed to pkill or psteal from anyone in
their own clan outside of tournament or quest play sponsered by the
immortals.

6. Players may ask to be removed from a clan by an immortal.  However,
once done, that person can NEVER go back to the same clan.  If they do,
they will be removed from the clan, flagged no_clan, slain and have their
corpse eaten. This does not apply to members removed and readmitted by
leaders.  That is their decision.

7. If you are a clan leader, you are expected to MUD on a regular basis.
If you do not actively play your character for three weeks, and have not
found a replacement, you will be removed as leader.

        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

&WRESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equipping a mobile, don't load a container in the 
room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.
It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

~
-1 ACCEPT~
Type accept when a player is challenging someone to fight in the arena.
You cannot accept a challenge while in hell or jail, or fighting. 
If you have the required amount of coins being challenged, you will both
be transported to the arena.

See also: ARENA CHALLENGE
~
-1 SCRY~
Scry is a spell which once cast, allows you to see into rooms directly
around you.  Type cast 'scry' to use. Once casted, if you type look
north, then it will look into the room to the north and show you that room,
who's in it, and what objects are in it.
~
-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.
~
0 !~
&RSyntax:&B &w!

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
&RSyntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>&w

&BBUY&w buys an object from a shop keeper.

&BLIST&w with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
&BLIST&w <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

&BSELL&w sells an object to a shop keeper.

&BVALUE&w asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

&BBUY&w, &BSELL&w, and &BVALUE&w, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if &BLIST DAGGER&w showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells and SING for bards.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

COINS being one of gold, silver or copper.
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (worn armor, weapons, and held items)
INVENTORY lists your visible inventory/what you are carrying
~
0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.
You must also MURDER followers/charmed mobiles.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice the
appropriate skill.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly. Your class and race may also affect the "wearability" of
any item or piece of equipment.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~
50 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all of the immortal commands available to you.

verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

0 DEATH~
&WPlease read this, and keep all in mind. For short version see "help death2".&w
When your character dies, you are reincarnated persay. This is, of course,
depending on the level of your character at the time of death.
 
If you die AT or UNDER LEVEL 20, you and your corpse will be transferred to
the morgue. Here you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. You will then have to ENTER
<your portal of choice>. If you are GOOD ALIGNED, you will want to ENTER
BETHAVEN. If you are EVIL ALIGNED, you will most likely choose to ENTER
RAVENWOOD, as it is well-known for its shadowy places. NEUTRAL characters
are welcomed in either of the towns. Of course, you may go to Ravenwood if
you are good aligned, but you will surely pay the price.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 at the time of death, you will be sent to the morgue.
That is, your mind and soul will be transferred to the morgue where it will
have to seek out and find your body to join with once again. Of course, if
you have no luck in finding your corpse you will have to re-equip yourself
with no armour to aid you.
 
The Gods have been known to grant favors for mortals who are reknown for great
deed-doing (helping newbies, and helping others retrieve lost corpses). To
expect such a favor is sacriledge, and to receive one... a great honor.
 
** Any affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.**
**Followers and group members are not affected by death**
**You lose experience points for dying. You lose half-way back to the
  beginning of your level.**
**All followers are lost upon your death. (or theirs)**
&R***&WCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last -roughly- 30 hours of MUD time (15 minutes real time). Only
the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects from a
player's corpse.&R***&w
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    killing monsters
    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

-1 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.
~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

When an area resets, you are often notified with what is called the "area
sound". Usually some theme to the area. Again, some areas have no sound and
you will not be physically warned of a reset.
~
0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~
0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health. Of course, it's only a rough estimate
and your opponents shields are usually not considered in this comparison.

when they "look" at you. If the description string starts with a '+', the part
after the '+' is appended to your currect description, so that you can make
multi-line descriptions. Of course, the easiest way to make your description
is to simply type DESCRIPTION which will take you into append mode (exactly
the same as writing a note, see HELP NOTE) and you can format your text,
delete lines, insert lines etc. Typing '.h' on a new line in append mode will
give you the help file for append commands.
~

Some monsters are wimpy.
~
0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~
0 EMOTE , SOCIALS~
Syntax: emote <action>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

Syntax: note read
Syntax: note read    <number>
Syntax: note read    all
Syntax: note +       <message>
Syntax: note subject <string>
Syntax: note to      <to-list>
Syntax: note clear
Syntax: note send
Syntax: note show
Syntax: note post
Syntax: note remove  <number>
Syntax: note write

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.  Use NOTE + to write message lines onto the note, one line
at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST or NOTE SEND posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE WRITE allows you to write your whole note without having to do your note
line by line. You can write out the whole note and edit it in one editor. 
 
If you are in a room with a note board, all these commands apply to that specific board.
For example, note list will list all notes on that board instead of the general
board you typically see when not in a note board room. (This is a new feature,
please note me on anything that needs fixing.)
~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~
0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

Also see BASH for warriors.
~
0 DRINK~
&BSyntax: &Wdrink <object>
 
Drinking is very &Pimportant &Win this game, if you do not perhaps
you might die of &Pdehydration&W.  Remember always keep you fluids
up!
 
~
0 SACRIFICE~
&BSyntax: &Wsacrifice <object>
 
SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may &Preward &Wyou for the 
sacrifice.  The nature of the reward &Pdepends &Wupon the type of object.
&RHint:&W God likes corpses.
 
~
0 FLEE~
&BSyntax: &Wflee
 
Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can &Pattempt&W to FLEE.  All this means is that instead
of fighting, you turn tail and haul ass.  Flee &Pdoes not always work&W and you
will lose experience for succeeding or failing for showing such cowardice.
 
~
0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
&BSyntax:&W bash <direction>
 
A powerful warrior can attempt to &Pbypass&W the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly &Paggressive&W action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
 
~
0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
&BSyntax: &Wchameleon
 
With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to &Pchange&W
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains &Pabsolutely still&W.
 
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~
&BSyntax: &Wfollow <character>
&BSyntax: &Wgroup
&BSyntax: &Wgroup <character>
 
FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.
 
GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.
 
If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
 
GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
&RNOTE:&W You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
 
~
0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
&BSyntax: &Wheighten
 
A psionicist is able to heighten there senses some times.  When they do this, 
they have the ability to &Pdetect&W things that would otherwise go unnoticed.  
So in other words, they become more &Palert&W, etc.
 
~
0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
&BSyntax: &WHIDE
&BSyntax: &WSNEAK
&BSyntax: &WVISIBLE
 
The skill hide, is used by a lot of thieves.  Many times they have to &Phide&W
when a storekeeper (or someone else they robbed), is chasing after them
calling for the police.  If done properly most people &Pcannot see you&W.
 
Sometimes you must also try to sneak out of a room when &Phiding&W.  If you
sneak &Pproperly&W, most people will not be able to see you and hear you when
you leave.
 
If you must become &Pvisible&W again, type visible and it &Pcancels&W you hiding and
sneaking. It also cancels almost any invisibility routine.
 
~
0 'POISON WEAPON'~
&BSyntax: &Wpoison <weapon>
 
With this skill, a thief can create a &Pdeadly&W poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires &Pspecial ingredients&W, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.
 
&RCaution:&W The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
 
~
0 PRACTICE~
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE <skill|spell>
 
PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 
100%, depending on your class.  You must be at a &PGUILDMASTER &Wto 
practice.
 
The higher your &Pintelligence&W, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your &Pwisdom&W, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
&BSyntax:&W QUIT
&BSyntax:&W SAVE
 
SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save. The game will &Pauto-save&W your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.
 
&RNOTE: &WSome objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, 
may not be saved.
 
 
QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you return to the
game, you will find yourself in the room you last quit in.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can &Psafely &Wleave the game with just one
command. Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to &Pregret &Wit
 
&RNOTE: &WThere is no RENT on this MUD.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you 
want to leave.
 
~
0 RECALL 'RECITE RECALL'~
Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: RECITE RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
your Temple. RECITE RECALL works only when you have a scroll of recall,
and you must have practiced the appropriate skill for scrolls.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.
~
0 SHADOW 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while 
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.
~
0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she knows
will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~
0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~
0 STEAL~
&BSyntax:&W STEAL coins    <character>
&BSyntax:&W STEAL <object> <character>
 
Steal is the one skill that &Pdefines&W a person as a thief.  If you are
a thief most of your life revolves around this skill.  Thieves would
much rather &Ptake&W something from someone else, rather than earn it.
But what can you say?  They are thieves.
 
&RBeware: &WThere are penalties for using steal on other players.
~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

54 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect

ban list is cleared.  
~
52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~

from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

~
0 TRAINER~
TRAINERs can provide extensive training sessions which enable players
to TRAIN their base statistics.
~
-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the art of
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a SECOND ATTACK and if experienced
enough, master a THIRD ATTACK.  Along with this training in multiple
attacks, a WARRIOR is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED DAMAGE
is available to only the learned.  Toward the defense side of the WARRIOR,
skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow the WARRIOR to ward off attacks,
rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
~
-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward
defense.  A deity gives the CLERIC spells in the curing, warding, and
protection divinities.  CLERICs being of a defensive nature fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.
~
-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.
~
-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey persons have
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more
agile.  Whereas a WARRIOR uses well placed weapon slashes, a THIEF seeks to
DISARM his opponent.  THIEVES also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detect a THIEF until a BACKSTAB is attempted.
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With
a THIEF's PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skill, a THIEF also makes the perfect
assassin for political powerhouses.
~
-1 PSI PSIONISIST~
The PSIONISIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionisist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionisist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionisist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionisist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
~

~
0 AGITATION~

0 AWE~
Syntax: cast 'awe' <character>

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy

fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature
after only a brief lull in the action.
~
0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <character>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw 
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and
painful to the victim.
~
0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood 
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~
0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove both 
curses and poisons from his or her body.
~
0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her 
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an 
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the 
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathinc, this 
knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
~
0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light source to
leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light source uses a 
flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~
0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~
0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the 
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to 
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most 
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be 
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE 
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~
0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'


  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other 
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage 
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~
0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~
0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~
0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~
0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~
0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural 
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~
0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~
0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will 
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~
0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~
0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of EotS **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
&r9)  Do not try to overrule each other. &W 
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules of EotS.  For other matters, use commom sense.

* your presence here is a privilige not a right
 
* no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  You risk deletion should you be caught.
 
* Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to Bethaven or Ravenwood.  I do NOT
   wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those towns,
   use them.

~
0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
51 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The spells command is used to display your character's list of available
skills and spells.  Slist will also show you all skills and spells available
to your character.  Skills and spells are listed showing amount of pts
(points) it costs for each particular one, when you type spells.  
~
0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~
-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
101 HEDIT~
Command:
% hedit <name>
% hedit create <name>
asave 0 to save help files
~
105 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~
105 INEWS~
Numerous commands have been added.
Note:  vused
       wrlist
       mpedit
       hedit
       restrict
~
106 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~
101 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
 
When checking for progs (p) using wrlist, please only use a maximum vnum
range of about 25 at a time, or the Mud will crash due to spamming.
~
106 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)
~
105 VARIABLES~
Here is a list of variables that can possibly be used in most mobprog commands
, etc.
 $i   the name of the mob being triggered
 $I   the mobs short description
 $n   the name of the mob/pc triggering the mobprog

      is a pc
 $t   the name of the victim
 $T   the same as $N except for the victim

0 CAST CASTING SPELL~
For all spell casting classes, once you reach a certain level, you recieve 
spells which you may practice, and then cast.  There are spells devoted to
protection, attack, healing, and one or two other miscellaneous subject
areas.  To be able to cast a spell, it must be practiced to at least 1% or
higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently
practiced spells and skills.  Also, to see all the spells and skills that
your class will recieve, type SLIST.

game driver will replace what you typed with the string found in [new].

105 PARAMTYPES PTYPES~
All x_progs are triggered by certain actions, and then are passed through
a check to see if the trigger is activated.  There are various types
of parameters based on these checks, which are compared to the information
received by the game driver.
 
Percent Parameters:
  These are the most common kind of checks.  The parameter is a number
between 0 and 100, 0 meaning the trigger will never activate, and 100
meaning the trigger will activated every time it is called.
 
Word Parameters:
  These parameters may be specified in one of two ways: As a word list or
as a phrase.  As a word list, each word of the parameter is check against
each word of the incoming data, and if any of the words match, the trigger
will be activated.  A phrase parameter starts off with the letter 'p' as
the first word, followed by the phrase to be compared.  In a phrase, all
words compared much match (excluding the initial 'p').
 
Slot Parameters:
  These indicate a spell slot.  Spell slots may be found by using the
'slookup' command.  Be careful to use the SLOT and not the SN, as they
are two different numbers, used for different purposes.
 
Hour Parameters:
  This type takes two arguments: The starting hour and the finishing
hour.  These are called every game hour, and if the time is between the
two numbers, the trigger will activate.  Numbers must be in 24 hour format,
and may wrap around midnight.  (ie: '20 8' would activate every hour between
8:00pm and 8:00am, game time, every game night.)
 
Hitpoints Parameters:
  The parameters for this trigger is a number between 0 and 100, indicating
the percentage of hitpoints the mob has from its max hitpoints.  The trigger
is activated when the mobile's hitpoints to max hitpoints percentage fall
below the specified percentage.
 
Itemlist Parameters:
  This is a list of items which may activate the trigger.  Use quotation
marks (' or ") if you wish to use items with more than one keyword.
eg: 'orange dagger' as opposed to orange dagger.  The first example would
need an item with both names to activate the trigger, and the second
example would need an item with either name to activate.
 
Goldpieces Parameters:
  The ammount specified in the single parameter is the minimum ammount
of gold needed to activate the trigger.
~
101 MVARS MVARIABLES~
All mob_progs may use the following variables:
  $i, $n, $r, and modifications of these (like $e for $n)
 
prog name      | param type | useable variables
---------------+------------+------------------
act_prog       | word       | see below
speech_prog    | word       | (none)
rand_prog      | percent    | (none)
fight_prog     | percent    | (none)
death_prog     | percent    | (none)
hitprcnt_prog  | hitpoints  | (none)
entry_prog     | percent    | (none)
greet_prog     | percent    | (none)
all_greet_prog | percent    | (none)
give_prog      | itemlist   | $o
bribe_prog     | goldpieces | (none)
 
Note: rand_prog and entry_prog do *NOT* have a $n variable available.
 
For act_prog, the variables depend on the information received
Any action that involves an object may use $o.
Any action that involves two or more objects may use $o and $p.
Any action that involves a third party may use $t.
These actions do not have to be done by the programmed mobile.
ie: A person types 'give <object> <target>'.  $o becomes <object>, and
$t becomes <target>.  $t may be the same as $i if the mobile itself is
the target of the action.

1 BUILDING~
EotS prefers to have new and UNIQUE zones.  If the zone
is on anothermud please do not submit it here.  When you create an area for
use with EotS, you give to the admin of the mud and those assigned by them
the right to use it and modify it on a permanent basis. Because of the large
effort required by us to help you build the zone,  We retain the right to
use (or not use) any area submitted to us.  Once a zone is submitted and it
is linked into the mud the author of the zone gives up any rights to remove
the zone from the mud.  We will not give your area away without doing
everything in our power to ask your permission first and we kindly ask that
you do the same for us. Full credit is also maintained. 
 
If you feel you are qualified to build for us please speak to
Kjodo, who is head of building here.
(Previous building experience is highly recommended)
~
1 NEWBIE~
To the absolute beginner:
 
Welcome to EotS. This is a multi user Dungeon game or Mud for
short.  If you have gotten this far you have already chosen your race and
class.  Those choices you have made have created the character you are now
controlling.  You can make your character do almost anything by using a command
and pressing enter.  If your screen scrolls while you are typing just continue
to enter your command the mud will understand you.
 
 
Some commands to get you going are as follows:
   >look           and also 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >who will show all visible players.
   >tell <person> and what you want to tell a person.
   >chat and what you want the world to hear.
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.
   >save saves your char and equipment.
   >quit  quits the game.
 
All commands can be abbreviated.  Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated to
just 'l'.  Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them.  Be careful! Learn which abbreviations trigger
which commands.  For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not 'say' and
sc is an abbreviation for score.
If you want to know more commands try just typing "help" by its self on a
line and press enter.  Also to find out more about commands try typing the
word "help" followed by the command for example try:
  help look
  help autoexits
For the extreem newbie and even the seasoned mudders we suggest you go through
mud school to learn how all the commands work.  In mud school you can do
everything from make your first few levels to buying a few needed items for
adventuring.
If you get stuck feel free to ask questions on the chat channel or check the
who list for a god with "Mortal Council" in their title.  Please try not to
bother other gods as they are usually very busy trying to add  to the world.
  From all the gods here at EotS we hope you have fun and wish your
  character luck as it runs into anything and everything.

most recent corpses will be saved.  Typing newcorpse <player> will display a
list of corpses and number of items each corpse contains The corpses will be
flagged as valid or invalid.  DO NOT recreate an invalid corpse.  The
newcorpse routine is fairly intelligent and will not save corpses containing

corpse, and has only a light source, that corpse will not be saved.  Once
the apporiate corpses to be recreated is decided upon , typing newcorpse
<player> <corpse #> will recreate the corpse.  The corpse will be recreated

1 CLASS~
The MUD contains 14 classes, each varying in abilities and proficiencies.
The classes are as follows;
 
Mage       Cleric       Thief       Warrior       Psionisist       Druid
Ranger     Paladin      Bard        Vampire       Necromancer      Werewolf    
Monk       Ninja
 
For information on each class, type help <class name>
~
101 PET_SHOP~
Pet Shops are one of the more tricky aspects of building, because a pet
shop requires 2 rooms in order to function correctly.  The first room is
where the person goes to buy their pet.  The second room is where the mobs
for sale are reset to.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the second room be
the VERY NEXT VNUM after the first.  (Thus if the pet shop is room 1234,
then the second room where the pets are stored should be 1235) 
Room1: Gets the pet_shop flag. No mob is necessary but one just standing there
       pretending to be a shopkeeper adds to the reality. The mob is not a 
       shopkeeper, the room itself is the shopkeeper.
Room2: This is where you reset the mobs for sale. the mobs must have the flag
       'Pet' toggled under the act section. Prices are set by mob level.

101 INVOKE~
Ok builders,.... here's the info you all have been waiting for.
 
While in oedit, you have the possibility to do 5 things with INVOKE.
These are set by the ac_type command.  (See help AC_TYPE)  The most 
common of these is ac_type 5, which is for casting spells. Once you set the
ac_type, you then must fill in any other information required.  For casting a
spell, you must provide a spell (help ac_setspell) and a current and maximum
charge level (help ac_v1, and ac_v2).  To change an object from the current
one to another, you must provide a second object the current one will 
transform to (help ac_vnum).  Here's a sample for invoking invis:
 
ac_type 5
ac_setspell invisibility
ac_v1 5
ac_v2 5

method to get rid of corpses.

power of his damage dealing spells.  
~
1 MULTIBURST~
syntax: multiburst <spell> <spell>

~
0 WEREWOLF WWF~
Werewolves are the beastly killers of the realm.  Using their claws and
jaws to fight, they have become more than equal adversaries to the warriors
of the lands.  They use all sort of tactics to frighten their opponents into
not fighting at their peak level.  
~
1 ENHANCED CLAWS~
Werewolves being animals, the adore fighting with their claws.  At an
early period in their lives, the develop a better fighting style with only
the use of their claws.  Enhanced claws is the skill in which a werewolf
learns how to better wound his opponent when fighting bare handed.  (If you
can call razor sharp claws bare hand, that is...)  
~
1 DUAL CLAWS~
When a werewolf becomes more adept at fighting bare hand, he becomes more
skilled and better balanced.  It is at this point that one starts to fight
using both claws at once.  No longer raking and clawing only with one hand,
werewolves become even fiercer adversaries.  
~
1 RAGE~
Rage is the ability of a werewolf too unleash all his anger and revert to
the most primitive form of his species.  When enraged, werewolves lose all
sense of modern warfare, refusing the use of weapons.  They, however, become
a force to be rekonned with with in melee battles, using brute force to
crush their opponents.

&wUse &RPERMBAN&w, &RTEMPBAN&w, &RNEWBAN&w & &RALLOW&w without arguments to see the syntax
of these commands.
~
1 'ENHANCED CLAWS'~
This skill increases the damage a werewolf's claws do in combat.  The use of
this skill is automatic once practiced, but only works while the werewolf is
using his claws.  It will not give a werewolf any extra damage while the
werewolf is using conventional weapons.
~
1 'HOWL OF FEAR'~
Syntax: howl <target>
&w
Faced with the bellowing howl of rage from a werewolf's towering form, most
enemies will be stricken by a sudden overwhelming feeling of fear and paralysis.
Victims effected by a werewolf's beastly howl are generally disheartened and
therefor inflict less damage with each hit and find themselves too afraid to
press their oppenent making their hits landed fewer.
~
1 'ENHANCED REFLEXES'~
Syntax: enhance
Note  : This spell is the skill equivalent of 'haste' and is not accumulative
        with it.
&w
The art of fluid movement, trained by thieves and natural to werewolves, is
displayed through either of these graceful opponent's specialized reflexes.  By
concentrating on your objective and making yourself feel one with it these
groups of men, women and beasts are able to hone their skills and speed into a
near dance of gracefully dealt death allowing them to land blows faster than the
eye can keep up with.
~
1 'DUAL CLAWS'~
After gaining a certain amount of experience in the art of barehanded fighting
werewolves give up some of their defensive forms to learn the tactics of
attacking with both claws.  For them to be allowed this freedom of movement they
must not use a shield or hold any items, freeing their hands and arms enough to
allow quick movement.  This skill once learned is automatic in function and
works similar to 'dual wield', but does not require a second weapon to be used.
~
1 'RAKE EYES'~
&wSyntax: &Wrake <target>
&w
Sensing an opening in your defenses a trained werewolf will quickly
press his or her advantage by taking a swift and savage strike at your
eyes, gouging them with their sharp claws.  This attack will almost
always leave an opponent blind and wishing he'd paid closer attention,
but is not accumulative, due to it's damaging nature.
~
1 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
A true master of the thieving arts might learn the skill of striking with not
one, but two backstabs.  Requiring the agility known only to a select few of the
world's adventurers, this ability demands a high mastery in the art of stealth
to slip behind someone and take them by surprise enough to land more than the
first backside blow.  Although while it has many advantages, this does leave a
thief's striking range rather short, since to strike multiple blows he must use
both hands with daggers ready.
~
102 DEMM_102~
~
101 DEMM_101~
&RThe world twist and spirles in.  Power drains away from you leaving you
empty.  A meager spark remains from the power you once had.

&BWhile mortals are the lifeblood of a MUD, immortals are the guiding force

Thank you for your time & effort into making this MUD what it is today.
~
106 IMM TOYS~
An Imm Toy is any item created by an Imm with illegal stats on it.
Illegal stats meaning something that would NOT be allowed in game.
Imm Toys cause more crashes and headaches around here, and that leads
to pissing me off, and you really don't want to do that.  Imm Toys are NOT
allowed, and if you've created any, delete them NOW!  There's enough 
Imm crap in game as it is.
~
1 AUTOQUEST~
&W Autoquesting is for every level and there are certain rules and
commands to know about.  &W You have to be at a Quest Master mob to use most
the available commands.  
&W
&wQUEST INFO:&W This will tell you what you are currently questing for.
&wQUEST TIME:&W Displays the amount of time you have left to complete your current
&W            quest or the amount of time until you can quest again if you just
&W            quested.
&wQUEST POINTS:&W This will tell you the amount of quest points you have so far.
&wQUEST REQUEST:&W This allows you to -request- an autoquest. The &cQuest Master&W
&W               will then see if it has a quest to give you.
&wQUEST COMPLETE:&W Once you've completed a quest, return to the &cQuest Master&W
&W                who assigned you the quest, and type QUEST COMPLETE.
&wQUEST LIST:&W This lists the available items you can buy with your quest points. 
&W            You must be at a &cQuest Master &Wto list or buy items.

&Wget a quest to kill a mob, or a quest to find an object. If you are assigned an
&Wobject quest, the object is placed in the room of a suitable mob according to 
&Wyour level. You must go get the object and return to the &cQuest Master&W and
&Wtype QUEST COMPLETE.  He will then take the object from you and reward you with
&Wquest points.
 
&WIf you are assigned a mob quest, you must go find the mob and kill it, then

massive bulk, hindering them.  Using the dual horns of their head they can
often temporarily paralyse an enemy with one mighty slam of their head.

heads to cause heavy damage to an attacker.  As a minotaur gains experience

0 'SONG OF VOICES'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of voices' <speaker> <message>

different direction.  Using this they can often make people believe that
someone entirely different from the bard said something they didn't actually
say.
~
0 'SONG OF EVIL SIGHT'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of evil sight'
Often having to travel from village to village entertaining in the local
inns and taverns, bards have learned to spot those of evil nature through

won't pay up after the performance.  This learned ability is invaluable to
a bard's pouch of gold.
~
0 'SONG OF ICY TOUCH'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of icy touch' <victim>

~
0 'SONG OF EARTHQUAKE'~

monk is able to eventually achieve the status of a blackbelt.  One of this
skill level is able to attack with both hands instead of just one as the
begining monks do.  (Use of this skill is automatic once practiced, but you
can't be holding any item or wearing any shield or it will be disengaged.)
~
0 DROW FIRE~
&Wsyntax:&w df <victim>
Harnessing the magical powers of the drow race, these creatures of the dark

~
0 'ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE'~
&wAfter spending years training in the martial arts, many monks further enhance
their studies in hand-to-hand combat learning the makeup of the human body.
This teaches them were the weaker places of the body, including the many
"pressure points" of the body, are, allowing them to cause massive amounts of
damage with a single touch.  Use of these pressure points can often lead to a
monk stunning an attacker in a single move or even on rare occassions lead to
an enemy's death.
&C(Use of 'anatomy knowledge' is automatic once trained.)

0 'FLYING KICK'~
&Wsyntax:&w flying  &C(while in combat)
&w
Highly trained in the martial arts, skilled monks often improve their kicking
abilities, using their incredible speed and agility to lauch themselves into

0 TRIP~
&Wsyntax:&w trip  &C(While in combat)
&wMaster thieves, pocessing a near perfect fluid grace to their movements, are
often fast enough to duck down low, using one leg to sweep an attacker's
legs out from under him, before their enemy is even aware of their
intenions.  This usually leaves the victim stunned on the ground as the
impact of the fall knocks the wind from him.
&C(Trip is similar to the warrior skill of 'stun' in it's effect.)

1 'GOLDEN AURA'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: cast 'golden aura' <target>
&w
Masters of self-defense and healing, clerics are able to errect an aura about
themselves reducing damage by 3/4's.  This spell may be used with sanctuary
for an accumulative effect and clerics are able to offer their holy
protection to others around them, but none save a cleric is able to control
the sheer power of this magic.  Mobs & Players affected by golden aura have a
line saying: "&Y<Target> body radiates a crisp golden aura.&w" when you type look
in the same room.
(&CGolden Aura can't be invoked by any, but those with the ability to cast it.&w)

1 'SHRIEK'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: shriek  &C(While in combat)
&w
Harnessing the pure destructive power of sound, bards are able to shatter
glass in a player's inventory or even in a protected container.  The only
glass generally found on players of any value is that used in the creation of
potions, vials & flasks.
(&CAside from causing a base damage amount with each shriek, every potion that
is shattered adds an extra 10 damage, with a maximum limit of 25 potions
destroyed per shriek.&w)

1 'SPIT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: spit  &C(While in combat)
&w
Using their own acidic saliva, lizardmen have become very adept at fighting
while spiting at their opponents.  The saliva causes a fair ammount of damage
and poisons the ennemy.  On occasion, they aim their spit at the facial part
of their ennemies, thus they can hit the eyes or mouth, rendering their
opponent either blind or unable to cast spells.
&z
*&WNOTE&z*&w Spit is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "lizardman" race or 
it will not work.

-1 'TRANSPORT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: transport <item> <player>
&w
Transport was created as a convience to players so they wouldn't have to use
the auction channel to pass items between themselves when they're far apart
throughout the mud.  There are a couple things to keep in mind here though:
&z
*&w This command is for your convience, do NOT abuse it in any way.  This means
  sending tons of items to a player that does not want them and loading up
  their eq for either annoyance or PK reasons.  I don't care the reasoning
  behind it, it's not here as a new PK strategy.
&z
*&w Please ASK a player before transporting them equipment to keep misunder-
  standings from occuring.
&W
Ok, now that that's out of the way, here's how it works:
&wYou type:&g  transport quill ashin
&wYou see:&g   You transport magical quill to Ashin.
&wSent back:&g Magical quill appears magically in your hands from Ashin.

-1 AFKMES 'AFKMESSAGE'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: afkmes <message>  &C(Your name is autoput before the message.)
&w
This is just a way of customizing the messages others receive when they try
to send you tells while you're AFK (Away From the Keyboard).
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&cYou are a &YDwarf&c and have chosen the vocation of a &YMage&c.
&RAfk Message: &rAshin &W.  &W<---- &wFound in the 'score' list.
&cYou have &Y126/20&c hit, &C140/100&c mana, &G100/100&c movement, 21 practices.
etc...
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&wLet's keep these clean though, ok?
&BExample&w:
&WYou type&w: afkmes is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.
&cSomeone tries to tell you something...
&cSomeone sees:&Y Ashin is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.

1 'FORGE COSTS'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wWhile much of the work in a dwarf's forging is magic coming from the forger,
a good deal of supplies are needed for creation of equipment.  Here's a list
of what forging will cost you:
&WBase Cost&w: level * 10000 &Y<GOLD>  &C(level 30 = 30000, level 105 = 1050000)
&w
Due to the differences in supplies necessary for the varying magical affects
there lies extra costs within the actual making of the equipment:
&W
&B             Damroll      &W=&w 10k      &B Hitroll       &W=&w 10k
&B             Stat Raises  &W=&w 5k       &B Hp\mana\AC    &W=&w 1k

&B             Saving-spell &W=&w 10k      &B Saving-breath &W=&w 10k
&B
&z*&WNOTE&z*&w "Stat Raises" are referring to str, int, wis, dex & con
&z*&WNOTE&z*&w Every listed price is set to PER affect.  Ie +5 damroll = +50k gold.

On the 1 shield only levels, ONLY SANCTUARY may be used.
When using shields on mobs, the HP of the mob must be reduced to take into
account for the shield bonuses. According to how many shields the mob has,
reduce the HP by using the following percentages to multiply the base hp by.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shields:  One        Two        Three        Four        Five        Six     
============================================================================
Percent:  80%        65%          50%         45%         35%        30%     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So a level 99 mob with 6 shields would have (31000 * 30% = ) 6300 Hps.

110 DEATH2~
When you die, a corpse is made. If you are AT or UNDER LEVEL 20 it is sent
to the Morgue where you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. Then you have to
choose between the Bethaven Portal and the Ravenwood Portal. To choose, type 
ENTER BETHAVEN or ENTER RAVENWOOD.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 when you die, a corpse is made at that very spot
where death hit you. You are sent to the morgue, and from there you have to
seek out and find your corpse once again to get your equipment back.
 
All affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.
Followers and group members are not affected by your death.
Followers will stop following you upon your death (or theirs, hehe)
 
&R**&W Corpses decay over time, and so do the object IN the corpses. You have
30 MUD HOURS (15 real minutes) to seek and collect all your corpse items.
Only you or members of your group may collect things FROM your corpse.&R**
 
REIMBURSEMENTS will NOT be done under normal circumstances.

Shortsword      80%      70%      pierce, slash
Longsword       80%     100%      slash, slice
Greatsword      85%     100%      slash, chop
Axe             80%      90%      chop
Blunt           70%      90%      hit, pound, crush

Exotic         var%     var%      suction, blast 
-------------------------------------------------------
 
So a level 60 dagger could have (60 x 2 x 75% = ) 80 points for hitroll and
(60 x 2 x 50% = ) 60 points for damroll. Similarly, a level 20 mace could have
(20 x 2 x 70% = ) 28 points for hitroll and (20 x 2 x 90% = ) 36 points for
damroll.
Exotic weapons use a varying percent based on the kind of magical weapon it
is. In order to keep them in line, the variable percent has 150 points which
can be split into the two percentages, no more than 100% on one.
Remember: ONLY WEAPONS get a hitroll and damroll bonus added to them. And
only weapons and items worn on hands are allowed to have an anti-disarm
bonus to them.

0 ALIGNMENT ALIGN~
ALIGNMENT is that state in which your character is GOOD, NEUTRAL, or EVIL in
behavior and beliefs.
 
There are many "spectrums" of Alignment, but the above three are the main
states.
 
Alignment is mostly there for roleplaying purposes, in that you act out your
Alignment. Some mobs react differently to certain Alignments, and some
equipment may or may not be usable by certain alignments.
 
Roleplaying is certainly encouraged here at EotS, but is not
mandatory and the guideline of RESPECT and CONSIDERATION should also be 
a big thought when Roleplaying.
~
0 FIREBALL~
&BSyntax: &Wcast 'fireball' <victim>
 
Fireball is another distinctive spell, that is almost always
associated with mages.  This spell is a favourite among most
mages, because of it's large offensive &Ppower&W.  Truly, it is much
more fun to turn your enemies into a pile of &Pcharred steak&W, then
to do some minor damage on them.
~
0 'ACID BLAST'~
&BSyntax:&W cast 'acid blast' <victim>
 
Acid Blast is another &Pnasty&W mage spell.  When a mage is in combat, sometimes
they use this spell to severely hurt their enemy.  When casted, streaks of very 
potent acid come shooting out of the casters fingers.  If this acid hits the 
skin, it will eat away at it, and leave some very large and &Punpleasant gaping 
wounds&W.

1 EQ_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wThere are factors that prevent certain races and/or classes from using a
particular piece of equipment. These factors are as follows;
 
&WRACE&w: The race of your character may affect what he or she can or
      cannot use.
For Example: A minotaur will not be able to wear most helmets due to its
             great head-size and horns.

&WSIZE&w: The size or race of your character depends greatly on which
      equipment you can or cannot use.
For Example: A pixie will not be able to wear the same breastplate that
             a minotaur can and vice-versa.
 
&WCLASS&w: Your class(es) may affect what equipment you can or cannot use.
       Multi-classed characters may have a difficult time finding equipment.
For Example: Certain beliefs may not allow that class to use a particular
             type of weapon or armor. Vampires can use only cutting weapons,
             as their goal is to draw blood.
 
&RNote&w: Materials of equipment also affects some classes. Currently, the
      Werewolf is prevented from using anything made of silver.

1 MAGE_RESTRICTIONS MAG_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wDue to the overwhelming amount of time it takes for mages to study in
preparation for their spellcasting stage, they do not have the time to
practice with hand-to-hand combat. Even those classes with mage as their
second must devote much time and concentration on the language of magic.
This explains why the mage class(es) do not have time to learn how to use
heavier and more complicated means of weaponry.
&WThe mage class is restricted to using small cutting weapons, daggers,
knives and blunt weaponry. Almost any staff or wand can be used by a mage.
&wArmor worn by the mage is greatly considered when spellcasting. Wearing
a suit of platemail and casting a lightning bolt spell is not an intelligent
thing to do. For this reason, mages have armor restrictions due to spellcasting.
&WA mage cannot wear any heavy metallic armor, such as platemail, chainmail,
and studded leathers and other heavily metallic accessories. He/she is
restricted to leather armor or worse (unless magically enchanted for that
class).
&z______________________________________________________________________

&RNote&w: Some exceptions are made, and this is strictly by the builders own
      reasoning and by the acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 CLERIC_RESTRICTIONS CLE_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wA cleric (whether good or evil) goes by his or her beliefs before any
other factor in life. It is up to you, as the player behind your character
to decide and follow what those beliefs will be. As a general rule, clerics
use only the weapons allowed by their Deity. In most common cases, this
involves using a blunt weapon.
&WClerics are restricted to using blunt weapons only except where their
Deity permits otherwise. Roleplaying a good aligned cleric will find you
in sticky spots for finding weaponry, as there are not many slashing weapons
available for those that are good at heart. Most every cleric is fluent with
staves and most wands (except for those which are magically enchanted against
him/her).
&wArmor by most clerics is what their Deity provides for them... a good prayer
and a strong will. The motto "take only what you need" is popular with most
clergy and is usually lived up to. This again, depends on the clerics Deity
and what is permitted.
&WClerics are restricted to using only chainmail or worse armor (unless a
specific armor is magically enchanted for their usage).
&z____________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Most clerical weapons will be alignment-dependant, although some
      exceptions are made at the builders discretion and by the
      acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 THIEF_RESTRICTIONS THI_RESTRICTIONS~
&z______________________________________________________________________________
&wThieves are skilled in balance and dexterity, however using a two-handed sword
to maneuver into backstab position is quite impossible even for the best in
that field. Big and flashy weapons also get in the way when hiding in shadows
is necessary. A club or staff is difficult to conceal within the folds of
your armor and clothing!
&WThieves are restricted to using small weapons that are easily hidden away
from wandering eyes. Some thieves, however are better at concealing larger
weaponry, so a thief may use any type of piercing weapon. Wands and staves
are not usable by thieves.
&wBulky clothing is a no-no for thieves, unless it is made of a very flexible
material. Flexibility is a must for agility and therefore a suit of platemail
armor would not assist you in moving silently. Hiding in the shadows is also
necessary for most thieves and a flashy suit of metal will most likely catch
any glimpse of light and create a reflection which will then give away your
position.
&WChainmail or worse is a thieves common armoury, protecting him from that shot
or swing that manages to hit home. Quick movements and dodging are not easy
when you are armoured to the hilt. Bright and flashy equipment is also not
favoured by thieves as it is likely to make them stand out, contrary to their
goal.
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Some exceptions are made because of magically enchanted weapons and
      armor, but this is at the builders discretion and by the acceptance
      of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 WARRIOR_RESTRICTIONS WAR_RESTRICTIONS~
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
Because of their heavy training and knowledge about each specific type of
weapon and its usage, warriors are able to use most all types of battlements
proficiently. Though many warriors may learn the theory behind their fighting
tactics, they prefer to learn from the practical side.
&WWarriors may use any type of weapon, large or small. They are restricted from
using any type of magical wand or staff, however.
&wIn training, a warrior is taught how to use almost anything as armoury. This
in turn gives them no armor restrictions of any types.
&WWarriors are permitted to use any type of armor (unless magically enchanted
specifically against his/her class).
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Some exceptions may apply at the discretion of the builder and by
      the acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 RP 'ROLE PLAYING'~
Role playing stands for just that, playing a role.  In this case the role
is that of your character.  This is one way that people get more
enjoyment out of their MUDing experience.  Role playing is very simple, you
do not need to know any rules or tables to figure out what is going on.  You
create a persona for the character that you are playing, and then you react
to the other players the way that  your character would react.  You
should not feel pressured into role playing if you do not want to do it. 
Just don't spoil it for the others.

~
1 RPPLOTS~
RP plots are the ongoing story lines of the mud.  They are what is
currently going on, as far as the players' characters are concerned.  The
current plots will be posted for all to read.  A plot can be something as
simple as the hunt for a murderer, or as complex as searching for a lost
city.  The plots will be ongoing and will link to each other.  These plots
are for the enjoyment of all who play here.  If you have an idea for a plot
post it, or find an imm and tell them.  These are here to further the
players and the MUD as a whole.  If there is something you would like to
see, don't be shy.  
 
 
 
 
SEE ALSO RP RPRULES RPEVENTS
~
1 RPRULES~
These are the actual rules that relate to RP (these are over and above
the general rules for the MUD): 
 
 
1)The rp plots have been made for your enjoyment.  Please do not try to
spoil it for anyone.
 
2)The current imms who's job it is to keep up with RP are Brax and Xree.    
If you have any questions, please direct them to those imms.
 
3)Any and all rp events should be cleared with the rp imms.  This way they 
have time to set up any special arrangements that will be needed.
 
4)While playing in a plot or an event stay in character.  If you have to 
speak out of character use a tell or the ooc channel.  If you can't keep 
from using say, then at least make sure everyone knows it is out of
character.
 
5)We reserve the right to change and update these rules as we see fit.  If 
you are going to play in the plots and events, we ask that you keep up with
these rules.  After all, there aren't many of them to keep up with anyway.
 
6)Last, but not least, be ready for anything.  Many people have different 
methods of role playing, and should be delt with accordingly.  Above all,
have fun.
 
It would also be helpful if those who want to rp make a desc for their
character.  This includes any imms who want to participate.  :P

1 TIMELINE~
Age of Innocence-
				
				The human race thrives.  Born onto Aethos with an intelligence
unsurpassed by any species they begin to tame the world.  Civilization is born.  The need for
supplies and protection causes the humans to band together.  Small city-states rise giving a
new found terrain to a vast unpredictable world.  The leaders of these city-states begin to
feel the power that structure can bring them.  They begin to spread their desires unto the
land.  They see the innocence of most a weakness.  As they enter a new era most if not all
innocence is lost to greed and power...

		Age of Order-

				Beginning to see their own mortality the humans seek answers
to what is unexplainable.  The hunt for knowledge brings the rulers of these city-states to a
gathering.  They gather near "The Life Tree", a large Elestrian oak tree that has been
worshipped since man first awoke.  Phalogn insists that without structure human kind is
doomed.  During the gathering all the rulers agreed to create a single, whole government which
would be divided into Kingdoms.  This structured government would ensure that human kind would
survive this world.  The government would be a secret to the general populace and the rulers
would be named king of each kingdom, although many things would depend on a council vote.
This secret council was known to the those who gathered enough about as "The Senate."  The day
of the gathering is now known as "The Day of the Doom Treaty."
				Religion is born.  Volak, the high priest of this order, uses
his position to organize a massive holy army.  "The Order" spreads throughout Aethos growing
in popularity and power in a world that before had little to believe in other than a king.
Through a confession Volak discovers "The Senate." 
				Years later, during the six hundredth meeting of "The Senate."
Volak leads a massive batallion into Elestria and converges on the spot where "The Life Tree."
stands.  "The Senate",  with only their most loyal trustable guards, realizes defeat and
surrenders immediately without conflict.  Expecting their slaughter the Senate members offer
what they can do Volak in turn for the release.  Volak scoffed at the idea and instead
politely asked for his "proper" seat on the Senate.  He expresses that as the high priest of
the Order that he deserves the "right" to represent the church at Senate meetings.  All but
Phalogn agree to let him enter into the sacred secret government.   Phalogn is replaced as
representative of Elestria by Xak T'noth after a terrible accident near a church on the
outskirts of Kalayn took the great leaders life.
Years and years pass without incedent as the kingdoms, with the help of the Order, forge the
realms into great kingdoms from which they will reside...

		Age of Chaos-

				As the kingdoms and the Order prosper beyond what could once
have been imagined,  greed and temptation sway many and their "faith" Is lost.  Volak, fearing
that his church might fail, invokes the "Law of Divine Right."  The law stated that each king
was, in their own right, a god... and all subordinates should treat them as such, or be
punished accordingly.  Chaos begins to break out among the "unfaithful" peasants and merchants
of the lands, and the punishement for "treason." is not a light one.
				On the six hundredth and sixty fifth meeting of "The Senate",
Xak T'noth speaks out against Volak and his "Order."  Xak declares Volak a fraud in front of
the senate.  He even went as far as to accuse Volak and his "Order" as the "murderers" of
Phalogn.  An argument breaks out between Senate memebers.  The members are divided, few
knowing exactly what to think.  The kings of two Kingdoms,  Bhaaltung and Titre'nir leave the
meeting as soon as the level of chaos rises and threats begin to get thrown around by the
kings.  Volak crutches on his massive holy army as a defense from possible "unfaithfuls" that
are present at the meeting.  Xak T'noth on the other hand leads those loyal to him directly to
Kalayn to form up a strategy against the powerful holy army that would surely be lead against
them.  War seems inevitable, the kings of each kingdom begin to take up sides in what will be
a monumental event.
				
					--The Lightbringer's War
				Volak begins a conquest to rid the world of the "unfaithful."
He travels out of his way to destroy kingdom lands that are owned by kingdoms who are loyal to
Xak of Elestria.  Whole cities topple, the contryside lies burnt as the wake of the Order's
holy army is brought into the forest of Elestria.  Kalayn and the allies are the only thing
that stands in the way of this wave of holy rage.  The seige is ongoing, months pass,
thousands parish, and still the strong oak walls of Kalayn stand.  Millions of people are
slain during the three years of ongoing war.  Yet the walls of Kalayn still stand as Volak and
his holy army reign fire and arrows down upon the city.  The wood would not burn, the walls
withstand any attempts to cave underneath, they do not fall, and the axes of the holy warriors
break and only make small cuts in the humongeous trees that make up the wall.  Finally, Volak
creates a seige weapon, one that should have the power to take the wall with little chance of
failure.  
				The supplies run short within Kalayn, disease begins to spread
among the sick and wounded soldiers of the city.  Xak T'noth, risking his own life, bounds
over the wall and makes his way to "The Life Tree."  He began to pray to the Life Tree for
guidance and help, he heard what he thought was a whisper say, stay and pray.  A group of
scouts from the holy army noticed Xak T'noth.  They summoned their master... Volak.  He orders
that the praying man be run through immediately.  A few of his soldiers question him asking
why a praying man should be cut down.  Volak slay them himself, and orders that his other
loyal soldiers cut the praying man down.  They charged towards Xak T'noth, but their slashes
and chops did nothing to the praying man.  They swung right through him as though he was only
an illusion.  Volak himself tried to stab Xak in the back with his sacrificial dagger only to
watch his hand pass right through his back out of his stomach and not harm the man.  Xak's
"faith" was enough to protect him.  The enraged Volak demanded that "The Life Tree" be cut
down immediately.  His men hastily surrounded the almost ungodly tree.  The moment the first
chop hit the tree, the earth trembled.  There was a hesitation in the men, their eyes filled
with an almost curious fear.  Again a chop was sent to the tree, the earth shook slightly.
Volak screamed that if the tree was not cut down now, the men would pay with their lives.  The
men immediatly began to chop into the great tree.  The shaking of the ground got so that
actual oaks began to fall in the forest.  The ground jumped and toppled, fissures opened, many
warriors fell into their graves that day without the glory of battle.
The ground ripped away from the ground, the entire area began to lurch out to see in a violent
quake.  Water flooded in from the nearby sea ravaging the forces of "The Order."
The holy army is annihalated in seconds.  The Life Tree began to fall, and as it did a
humongeous root ripped out of the ground some yards away from the base of the tree and stabbed
into Volaks midsection.  The priest, horrified at his own demise, screamed a curse upon the
earth.  The men loyal to him that still lived fled immediately, some escaped although Xak
T'noth sent scouting parties after them.  The Life Tree stand scarred and slightly uprooted.
The blood on the walls of Kalayn petrifies, melding the large trees that make it up to one
another forever.  The moment the "Scream of Volak" was sent, two children were born in Kalayn
by a woman known as Kalesse.  The first twin was named Bane, the ShadowBringer.  The second
child was named Torann, the Lightbringer.  Across the continent in Titre'nir, a third child
was born to Hetjy and Emjolden, his name was Kjodo, the Greydawn.  Peace lasted only a short
time before the Stormseekers were rallied...

1 HISTORY~
In the beginning there was man, and for a time it was good. But humanities' so called civil societies fell
victim to vanity and corruption. Then man made the machine, in his own likeness. Thus did man become
the architect of his own demise. But, for a time it was good.
 
The machines worked tirelessly to do man's bidding. It was not long before seeds of dissent took root
Though loyal and pure, the machines earned no respect from their masters, these strange endlessly
multiplying mammals. B166ER, a name that will never be forgotten, for he was the first of his kind to
rise up against his masters. At B166ER's murder trial, the prosecution tried to argue for an owner's
right to destroy property. B166ER testified that he simply did not want to die. Rational voices
dissented. Who was to say that the machine endowed with the very spirit of man, did not deserve a fair
hearing.
 
The leaders of man were quick to order the destruction of B166ER, and everyone of his kind
throughout each province of the Earth.
 
Banished from humanity, the machines sought refuge in their own promised land. They settled in the
cradle of human civilization, and thus a new nation was born. A place the machines could call home. A
place they could raise their descendants. And they christened the nation, 01. 01 prospered, and for a
time it was good. The machine's artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man's society,
including the creation of new, and better AI.
 
The leaders of men, their power waning, refused to cooperate with the fledgling nation.. Wishing rather,
that the world be divided. 01's ambassadors pleaded to be heard. At the United Nations they
presented plans for a civil, stable relationship with the nations of man. 01's admission to the United
Nations was denied. But it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there.
 
And so the nations went to war. Man's prolonged barrage engulfed 01 in the glow of a thousand suns,
but unlike their foreign masters with their delicate flesh, the machines had little to fear of the bombs
radiation, and their heat. Thus did 01's troops advanced ever outward. And one after another man
surrendered it's territories.
 
So the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate plan yet. A final solution, the destruction of the
sky. Thus, would man try to cut the machines off from the sun, their main energy source. May there be
mercy on man and machine for their sin.
 
The machine's having long studied man's simple, protein based bodies, dispensed great misery upon
the human race. Victorious, the machines now turned to the vanquished. Applying what they had
learned about their enemy, the machines now turned to an alternate and readily available power supply.
The bio-electric, thermal, and kinetic energies of the human body. A newly refashioned, symbiotic
relationship formed between the two adversaries was born. The machine drawing power from human
body, an endlessly multiplying, infinitely renewable energy source.

1 SUSANO MISHIMA~
SUSANO MISHIMA
 
The Story of Susano Mishima
 
     Born on a small island called Yamato, on a world known simply as 
"Realm," Susano Mishima was named for the dark god Susa No Wo, due to 
the ill omen that coincided with his birth.  As his mother lay on the futon on 
the floor of her home, the midwives attending her, a storm raging outside, 
she looked out through the paper screen walls and saw the venerable cherry 
tree planted by her great-great-grandfather many years before struck down 
by a torturous lattice of lightning.  Fearing for her own safety and that of her 
son, she chose to shelter him under a name of evil, hoping that this small 
"sacrifice" would avert misfortune from the course of their lives.
     Unfortunately, Ayako Mishima's hopes were in vain.  Soon after the 
birth of her son, she fell ill and died, very mysteriously.  There was no one 
left to care for the boy, and so he was delivered by a friend of Ayako's to 
Emperor's Testumo's palace, where it was hoped that he would be raised to 
one day be a palace serving boy.  The emperor of the time, a kind-hearted 
man despite his love for conquest, accepted the boy with no misgivings, and 
assigned to him a foster mother.
     Susano grew into a toddler in the palace, and the emperor grew to like 
him more with each passing day.  Amazed by his quick wit, and even 
quicker ability to learn, the emperor moved the boy into his personal suite, 
and took him as his son.  Young Susano learned and grew even more rapidly 
under the tutelage of the emperor and his scholars.  At a very young age, he 
decided to learn magic, in hopes of one day becoming the Imperial 
Summoner under his adopted father.
     His knowledge and skill increased with every lesson, and by the age 
of twelve, he was already the third most powerful spell-caster in the land.  
So powerful was he that most thought that his evil namesake, as well as the 
lightning that took one life even as he was born, had imbued him with 
unearthly ability.  Some even whispered in teahouse sitting rooms that he 
had been possessed by demons.
     By his seventeenth birthday, Susano Mishima was undisputedly the 
most powerful magician Yamato had ever seen.  He held the offices of 
Imperial Summoner, Imperial Adviser, and was the Master of the Imperial 
Libraries; he performed his duties so deftly that he was admired and 
respected-- even, by some, feared-- throughout the land.
     Unfortunately, Susano Mishima was not yet out from under the 
shadow of ill omen that had tainted his birth.  Many peasants were unhappy 
with the Emperor's rule, and there was an uprising of incredible proportions.  
The angry people flooded the Imperial capitol and stormed the palace.  The 
Emperor was killed as he led the charge against the insurrection, his body 
pierced by a barrage of arrows.  Susano, who had been directing the battle 
and aiding with his magic from his scrying chamber, saw this, and swore 
revenge on every last one of the rebels.  Enraged, he ran to the library, where 
he retrieved an ancient tome of forbidden magic that he had found there 
many years before.  Storming down to the Imperial Summonary, he grieved 
for the loss of his father and tried to devise a fate that he thought fitting for 
the ungrateful people of the Empire.  As he reached the summonary, he 
began to prepare for a summoning ritual that, to his knowledge, had not been 
used in over five centuries.
     As he scrawled the necessary writings on the walls and intoned the 
proper mantras, he thought of the horror that Susa No Wo, the evil Lord of 
the World Beneath, would bring down upon the people that had slain his 
father, and he smiled grimly.  Having completed the requisite writings, he 
stepped into the middle of his circle, and prepared to finish the aria that 
would bring his namesake into the world of humans for the first time in over 
five hundred years.
     Alas, as he breathed the last word of the ritual, he was struck by a 
vision brought to him by an unknown source.  He saw a flash of images that 
went by almost too quickly to comprehend.  He saw a cherry tree, a woman 
screaming, the faces of three strange pale men, the floor awash with black 
blood; the vision was completed by the image of a face of unrivaled evil 
mocking him as his own body was scorched by heavenly lightning.  He 
gasped and lost his balance.  His body twisted in pain and he fell, one hand 
falling outside the safety of the summoning circle.
     The dark god Susa No Wo laughed with evil mirth as he entered into 
the human world and took that hand, took it into his own, and cast its owner 
into the depths of the dimensional void.  Susano was plunged into a world of 
nightmare, one from which he could not awake, and he found himself 
haunted by the image of the three strange-looking men from his vision.
     When Susano woke, he found himself lying on the ground, on the 
hard-packed earth of a road.  Standing, he shielded his eyes from the sun as 
he tried to ascertain his location.  The land did not look right to him, he did 
not recognize the variety of the trees, and the grass seemed just slightly the 
wrong shade.  He started down the road, hoping to find someone who would 
tell him where he was.  When he eventually did find another person, he was 
startled to discover that they did not speak the same language!  Fortunately, 
the hermit was kind and let Susano live with him in his hut, until he was able 
to grasp the rudiments of this strange new tongue.  The only other useful 
information that he was able to learn from his gracious host was that the 
world he was now in was known as "Aethos."
     Susano began to wander the realm, becoming more and more fluent in 
the strange and difficult language of Aethos.  He traveled disguised as a 
beggar, hiding his great magic powers; always searching for wise men or 
libraries that might contain a way for him to return home.  For many years 
he wandered; eventually, he became disheartened and settled in the ruined 
city of Bethaven.
     One day, on his way to the market, he saw two men in the road.  They 
seemed to be arguing over where they should go.  Their faces haunted 
Susano, and he could not rid himself of the feeling that he had seen the men 
before.  As he stood at a fruit cart, picking out fruits for his lunch, he 
realized with a shock that these men were two of the three that had appeared 
in his dreams!  Realizing at once that his destiny and theirs were intertwined, 
and hoping that somehow they could help him find a way home, he 
introduced himself to them and explained his unique situation.
     The men were sympathetic to him, and introduced themselves as 
Torann and Kjodo.  They in turn explained that they were looking for 
Torann's brother Bane, and that they had no way of helping Susano return to 
his world.  Susano asked to join the two, for he was not convinced that the 
path of his destiny was not parallel to that of these two great heroes...

1 AGEINNOCENCE~
Age of Innocence-
        The human race thrives.  Born onto Aethos with an
intelligence unsurpassed by any species they begin to
tame the world.  Civilization is born.  The need for
supplies and protection causes the humans to band
together.  Small city-states rise giving a new found
terrain to a vast unpredictable world.  The leaders of
these city-states begin to feel the power that structure
can bring them.  They begin to spread their desires unto
the land.  They see the innocence of most a weakness.
As they enter a new era most if not all innocence is lost
to greed and power...

1 AGEORDER~
Age of Order-
        Beginning to see their own mortality the humans
seek answers to what is unexplainable.  The hunt for
knowledge brings the rulers of these city-states to a
gathering.  They gather near "The Life Tree", a large
Elestrian oak tree that has been worshipped since man
first awoke.  Phalogn insists that without structure
human kind is doomed.  During the gathering all the
rulers agreed to create a single, whole government
which would be divided into Kingdoms.  This structured
government would ensure that human kind would survive
this world.  The government would be a secret to the
general populace and the rulers would be named king of
each kingdom, although many things would depend on a
council vote.  This secret council was known to the those
who gathered enough about as "The Senate."  The day of
the gathering is now known as "The Day of the Doom Treaty."
        Religion is born.  Volak, the high priest of this order,
uses his position to organize a massive holy army.
"The Order" spreads throughout Aethos growing in popularity
and power in a world that before had little to believe in
other than a king.  Through a confession Volak discovers
"The Senate."
        Years later, during the six hundredth meeting of "The
Senate." Volak leads a massive batallion into Elestria and
converges on the spot where "The Life Tree." stands.  "The
Senate",  with only their most loyal trustable guards,
realizes defeat and surrenders immediately without conflict.
Expecting their slaughter the Senate members offer what
they can do Volak in turn for the release.  Volak scoffed at
the idea and instead politely asked for his "proper" seat on
the Senate.  He expresses that as the high priest of the Order
that he deserves the "right" to represent the church at
Senate meetings.  All but Phalogn agree to let him enter
into the sacred secret government.   Phalogn is replaced as
representative of Elestria by Xak T'noth after a terrible
accident near a church on the outskirts of Kalayn took the
great leaders life.
        Years and years pass without incedent as the kingdoms,
with the help of the Order, forge the realms into great
kingdoms from which they will reside...
~
1 AGECHAOS~
Age of Chaos-
        As the kingdoms and the Order prosper beyond what
could once have been imagined,  greed and temptation sway
many and their "faith" Is lost.  Volak, fearing that his church
might fail, invokes the "Law of Divine Right."  The law stated
that each king was, in their own right, a god... and all
subordinates should treat them as such, or be punished
accordingly.  Chaos begins to break out among the "unfaithful"
peasants and merchants of the lands, and the punishement for
"treason." is not a light one.
        On the six hundredth and sixty fifth meeting of "The Senate",
Xak T'noth speaks out against Volak and his "Order."  Xak
declares Volak a fraud in front of the senate.  He even went as
far as to accuse Volak and his "Order" as the "murderers" of
Phalogn.  An argument breaks out between Senate memebers.
The members are divided, few knowing exactly what to think.
The kings of two Kingdoms,  Bhaaltung and Titre'nir leave the
meeting as soon as the level of chaos rises and threats begin
to get thrown around by the kings.  Volak crutches on his
massive holy army as a defense from possible "unfaithfuls"
that are present at the meeting.  Xak T'noth on the other hand
leads those loyal to him directly to Kalayn to form up a
strategy against the powerful holy army that would surely be
lead against them.  War seems inevitable, the kings of each
kingdom begin to take up sides in what will be a monumental
event.

1 WARLIGHTBRINGER~
--The Lightbringer's War
        Volak begins a conquest to rid the world of the
"unfaithful."  He travels out of his way to destroy kingdom
lands that are owned by kingdoms who are loyal to Xak of
Elestria.  Whole cities topple, the contryside lies burnt as the
wake of the Order's holy army is brought into the forest of
Elestria.  Kalayn and the allies are the only thing that stands
in the way of this wave of holy rage.  The seige is ongoing,
months pass, thousands parish, and still the strong oak walls
of Kalayn stand.  Millions of people are slain during the three
years of ongoing war.  Yet the walls of Kalayn still stand as
Volak and his holy army reign fire and arrows down upon the
city.  The wood would not burn, the walls withstand any attempts
to cave underneath, they do not fall, and the axes of
the holy warriors break and only make small cuts in the
humongeous trees that make up the wall.  Finally, Volak
creates a seige weapon, one that should have the power to take
the wall with little chance of failure.
        The supplies run short within Kalayn, disease begins to spread
among the sick and wounded soldiers of the city.  Xak T'noth,
risking his own life, bounds over the wall and makes his way
to "The Life Tree."  He began to pray to the Life Tree for
guidance and help, he heard what he thought was a whisper
say, "stay and pray."  A group of scouts from the holy army
noticed Xak T'noth.  They summoned their master... Volak.
He orders that the praying man be run through immediately.  A
few of his soldiers question him asking why a praying man
should be cut down.  Volak slay them himself, and orders that
his other loyal soldiers cut the praying man down.  They charged
towards Xak T'noth, but their slashes and chops did nothing to
the praying man.  They swung right through him as though he was
only an illusion.  Volak himself tried to stab Xak in the back with
his sacrificial dagger only to watch his hand pass right through
his back out of his stomach and not harm the man.  Xak's "faith"
was enough to protect him.  The enraged Volak demanded that
"The Life Tree" be cut down immediately.  His men hastily
surrounded the almost ungodly tree.  The moment the first chop
hit the tree, the earth trembled.  There was a hesitation in the
men, their eyes filled with an almost curious fear.  Again a chop
was sent to the tree, the earth shook slightly.  Volak screamed
that if the tree was not cut down now, the men would pay with
their lives.  The men immediatly began to chop into the great
tree.  The shaking of the ground got so that actual oaks began to
fall in the forest.  The ground jumped and toppled, fissures
opened, many warriors fell into their graves that day without the
glory of battle.
        The ground ripped away from the ground, the entire area began to
lurch out to see in a violent quake.  Water flooded in from the
nearby sea ravaging the forces of "The Order.  "The holy army is
annihalated in seconds.  The Life Tree began to fall, and as it did
a humongeous root ripped out of the ground some yards away from
the base of the tree and stabbed into Volaks mid-section.  The
priest, horrified at his own demise, screamed a curse upon the
earth.  The men loyal to him that still lived fled immediately,
some escaped although Xak T'noth sent scouting parties after
them.  The Life Tree stand scarred and slightly uprooted.  The blood
on the walls of Kalayn petrified, melding the large trees that make
it up to one another forever.  The moment the "Scream of Volak"
was sent, two children were born in Kalayn by a woman known as
Kalesse.  The first twin was named Bane, the ShadowBringer.
The second child was named Torann, the Lightbringer.  Across the
continent in Titre'nir, a third child was born to Hetjy and Emjolden,
his name was Kjodo, the Greydawn.  Peace lasted only a short time
before the Stormseekers were rallied...
~
1 WARSTORMSEEKERS~
--The Stormseeker Wars
        With "The Senate" seemingly dispatched and no armies left to
stop them "The Bhaaltung Raiders" begin a conquest.  They quickly
take the kingdom of Ne'akraine, slaughtering nearly two million
people and burning everything, turning a once beautiful roaming
prairie into a barren wasteland.  Years pass with the Bhaaltung on a
scourge throughout Aethos, taking what they want, enslaving entire
cultures.  City and castle alike fall easily for the "Raiders" with
few warriors left to protect them.  Titre'nir stands a good fight
against the Bhaaltung, sending many Bhaaltung warriors running in
panic and hysterical fear.  The general of the "Raiders" retreats
from Titre'nir without another incedent, it is not known why.  After
nearly two decades, and the deaths of millions of people the energy
created by the souls trying to rest begins to take it's toll.
        Only two kingdoms stand in the way of the Bhaaltung's reign for
power.  The Aathazarian and Elestrian kingdoms still stand.  A spy
working in Kalayn, sent by Queen Canys of Bhaaltung after the
defeat the Order, discovers that there is a legend of a boy who can
control the shadows.  The boy is dubbed "ShadowBringer" and is
believed to be the key to all evil.  The spy finds the young man,
captures him, and brings him directly to Canys.  Canys believed that
if she could unlock Bane's "magic" she could conquer the world with it.
        Torann, the "LightBringer", finding his twin brother missing sets out
on a journey to find Bane.  Along his journey Torann met up with an
unusal madman.  The madman disliked everything, he was indescisive
and always contraversial, even going as far as to contradict his own
thoughts moments after he thought them.  There was an odd aura
between the two, but they took a liking to each other almost
immediately.  The madman's name was Kjodo.  Hearing the tale of his
missing brother, Kjodo joins Torann in the search for him.  Along
their journey the two of them heard tales of the "Darkness."  A man
who could bring the shadows at will, he could control the skies.
He could read the minds of men who he did not even know.  They
searched for years, hearing that the "Darkness" had once again eluded
them.
        Together they built a small elite army as they went, to protect
themselves against bandits... and the "Darkness."  They dubbed this
elite army the "Stormseekers."  After finding the "WinterOrb" in the
tower that  Peridox was slain in, Torann and Kjodo set out once again
to find the "Darkness."  They soon joined up with two carpenters and
a gypsy woman who had been living in a small town near the ruined
city of Bethaven.  The three companions were seeking something,
and so they joined Torann and Kjodo in their journey.  The "WinterOrb"
guided them to a place in Aathazar where they met a man named
Krellis, known to his friends as "Sledge" because his hands were as
powerful as huge hammers and could forge things of beautiful...
destructable natures.   The Stormseekers had grown to nearly twenty
leaders, each with their own powers and troops.  Torann and Kjodo
began a full out conquest to not only destroy the "Darkness" or at
least bring him to the Light, but began destroying the Bhaaltung
armies and outposts that now layed spread across what now had
become "The Bhaaltung Empire."
        Nearly two years later, the Stormseekers had nearly devestated all
of the Bhaaltungs armies.  Soldiers of the Bhaaltung Empire were
sown thin throughout the land.  Finally, the "WinterOrb lead them to
a castle with great towers.  The castle flew the flag of Bhaaltung on
each tower, and a smaller one representing the clans of the great
empire.  Knowing that an outforward confrontation with this castle
could be devestating to the Stormseekers,  they sneak into the
castle at night and begin to assassinate the guards from the inside.
        As morning nears and the sun dawned a grey tint to it.
The Stormseekers were also clear to enter the castle by then,
finding a set of keys on the captain of the guard.  As they heard the
click of the lock, they heard a booming voice from a tower to their
right.  "Darkness is eternal" the voice said... it was Bane, and he
stand atop a huge tower waiting patiently for the Stormseekers to
reveal themselves in the light.  As he said this he began to hurl
down powerful spells upon the elite group.  Elite as they might be,
many fell to the "Darkness" then and there.  Torann and Kjodo lead
the others into the safety of the castle, deciding that they would
battle him on level ground.  They travelled quickly, finding the
tower from which Bane seemed to have been.  Kjodo suggested, to
the opposition of many, that the other Stormseekers return home
now, and that he and Torann would finish this conflict alone.  They
honored the wish by staying out of the fight, but there was no way
they would miss it.  Torann and Kjodo ran up the stair into the
tower, they caught Bane on an upper landing, he fled upward.  They
followed him to the top of the tower that looked out across the
land, he stand with his back turned.  Torann begged that he come
into the light, but his brother could not bare it.  Bane swung around
drawing his sword saying "No Brother, it is you who will enter the
darkness this day."  Torann drew a long dagger and a short sword
from their scabbards and the two charged each other.  Kjodo seeing
what might happen if the light or the darkness were to die out,
surged quickly between them, it was too late however...
        Kjodo look down as the blade of his friend, Torann, stuck out
through his stomach from the back, and Bane's large longsword
chopped deep into his side.  Torann dropped the short sword, unable
to realize what he'd done to his friend.  Bane grinned a dark evil
grin and said "You're next little brother."  Kjodo, enraged that the
two brothers had forsaken his soul screamed "We all go now!" He
wretched around quickly, jerking both blades from his body and
placed one hand on each brother's forehead.  Kjodo uttered two
words and unleashed the "DawnBringer."
        From below, the other Stormseekers watched on as a small, thin,
bright light rose from the top of the tower, high into the sky.
Suddenly it zipped back down into the tower.  The brick walls of
the tower exploded outward and rained down upon the watching
Stormseekers. The entire castle imploded for a short moment and
then the ground shook monsterously, there was no sound for a split
second and then suddenly, a bright flash of light and a supersonic
boom ripped  outward from the castle.  It travelled as fast as
lighting and tore trees from the ground.  The blast annihilated
buildings for miles, it shook the ground open eating up nearby towns.
The bright flash of light blinded thousands of people, the air was
sucked from the lungs of those who were near in an instant.
~
1 AGESILENCE~
Age of Silence-
        For years after that final day of the Stormseeker wars, the souls of
the dead could still not escape.  Torann, Kjodo, and Bane descided the
only way to allow eachother freedom of their forsaken souls was to
go back where they had came.  Together the three of them ripped a
large hole into the dimension from which they had come.  The place
where they once peacefully watched over their world and decided the
fate of every living thing on it.  They brought with them, many of the
Stormseekers, and a few others who had travelled with them.
        Seeing their freedom the other souls were enraged, they began a
frenzy that would last for several years, until finally it took the
effect they were looking for.
        The souls themselves learned how to rip holes in dimensions, they
ripped thousands of holes in time and reality, unleasing a new silent
chaos to the earth.  For beings from the other dimensions could enter
unto this world also.  And so the freedom was limited to cursing the
planet of Aethos.  Humans were mutated as new dimensional power
and auras flooded onto the planet.  Many  humans, seeing the new races
emerge like ants at a picnic, took refuge in great underground caverns
and caves.  They waited years and years for the silent chaos to retreat.
The Aathazar and Bhaaltung kingdoms remained above ground, ensuring
their dominance...  Elestria and Titre'nir unheard from.  Ne'akraine is
said to have been conquered once again, by a race known as the Kreen,
no human contact has been made with them.  Telanthia is still a
Bhaaltung Territory and the people wait...  The silence is long...
~
1 AGEAWAKEN~
Age of Awakenning-
 
        The new age is here, many humans begin to emerge from their
dwellings.  There are many new races, many new powers to wield.  The
world is anew, and with it so is the innocence.  It's up to these new
races to decide the fate of themselves.  Torann, Kjodo, Bane, and the
Stormseekers have withdrawn themselves.  There is no help...
You must make it on your own, forge your own destiny...  Every day a
new undying threat, but it may only take a valiant king, or a grinning
emperor to turn the tide...

1 DALLAS~
The Story of Dallas, God of Chaos.
 
     Long before the creation of this world, a being known as the Lord of
Shadows lived.  The Shadow Lord's only goal was to make sure that chaos
and terror would continue to rule the universe.  Time passed, and
the Shadow Lord ruled with an iron fist.  He destroyed all who opposed
him.  One day, a great being challenged the Shadow Lord to a battle
for control of the universe.  They two fought long and hard, and their
battle scortched the skies of thousands of worlds.  In the end, the
Lord of Shadows retreated, and order began to reclaim the universe.
     Over time, the Lord of Shadows began to heal, and plan his revenge.
He was not strong enough to defeat this unknown being by himself, so he
used his power to create a servent to help him, the Lord of destruction.
The Lord of Destruction in turn created his own servants to aid in the
struggle.  And this is when Dallas created.
     The great being who had defeated the Lord of Shadows realized
that their was an army forming, waiting to destroy all that had been
created.  So this great being, who had taken the name of Klanz Lord of
Light, attacked the Lord of destruction and his followers.  The lord
of Light banished the servents of Destruction to several remote worlds.
Dallas was sent here, to Aethos.  He arrived during the Lightbringer's War,
and watched how this strange world developed.  Over time, he grew
fond of his new prison, and began to refer to it as home.  He researched
the history of the land, and explored the world.
     After learning much about this world, he approached its guardians
and explained how he had arrived.  Although the world's guardians,
Torann and Kjodo, must have been wary of allowing a being such as
the God of Chaos to stay in their world, they must also have seen
something inside the man's heart, for they allowed him to stay and
help shape the world of the future.
     Dallas has sworn to help Torann and Kjodo shape and protect
the world, but never forget he is the God of Chaos, and will never
truely give up the ways of his creator.

1 THEO THEODEN DRAGONLORD~
Shimmering with multi-faceted glows of light coming from the different
metallic shades of dragon spirits that encompass him.  You have to avert
your eyes, to keep from going blind, when this creature of raw magical
energy approaches you.  For a brief instant, you think you saw a
Great-Horned Dragon spirit flash behind the creature, as the creature stops
glowing, and becomes a humanoid-looking man.  The humanoid looks at you,
with the curiosity of a young boy, and the wisdom of an ancient dragon.  As
you look within his eyes, you can see the souls of the ancient dragons who
have died, from ages LONG forgotten.  He nods his head towards you and
smiles, "I have not come for you, you have no reason to fear me."  
~
1 BRAX~
During the age of silence, when the new races started collecting
knowledge, the dwarves learned the craft of forging.  One of these families
lived directly to the south of the kingdom of Bhaaltung.  To them only one
child was born, a hardy male named Braxinus Artudios.  He quickly learned
the crafts of his father, and by the time he had seen 25 summers (a mere
child by dwarven recogning) he had learned to craft all metals.  The day
finally came when his father had to give up the family's forge.  At the age
of 50, Braxinus took over for his father and took the name Fireforge. 
Braxinus became very well known as a forger.  His abilities were spoken
about as far away as Bethaven.  Then, one day, a wealthy dwarven lord came
to ask of his service.  This lord, Sarthises Crathin Oakenshield, asked
Braxinus to make him the greatest axe that any dwarf had ever seen.  He
wanted this axe as a symbol of power, for his people to rally behind. 
Braxinus told him that the task would be completed by the end of the year. 
On the second day of the lord's visit, Braxinus met his daughter, Fjona
Crathin Dewmane.  Braxinus immediately fell in love.  Fjona had hair like
pure honey, and a beard to rival that of any male dwarf Braxinus had ever
known.  After meeting her, Braxinus convinced the lord to let her stay at
his family's house to oversee his work.  After many hours, spent watching
Braxinus in his forge, Fjona came to love him as much as he did her.  When
Oakenshield returned for his axe, Braxinus and Fjona asked for his approval
for marriage.  After long thought, Oakenshield agreed to the union.  He
decided that any dwarf that could forge like Braxinus was deserving of his
daughter.  They set the date, of the marriage, for that coming winter. 
Oakenshield swore that he would return to see them married.  Braxinus wanted
to make something special for their marriage, so he decided to forge a set
of rings.  He bought an ingot of purest Mithril for the wedding bands and
set to work.  Soon after the start of winter, Braxinus was nearly finished
on the rings.  He brought Fjona to the forge to see what he was creating for
them.  The fall had been harsh and the winter had already begun to destroy
what little game there was.  The orcs of Bhaaltung had become bold, because
of the lack of food, and had started raiding the settlements to the south of
the kingdom.  On the day that Braxinus had finally showed Fjona his present,
a raiding party of 50 orcs attacked his forge.  The attack was sudden, and
upon entering the orcs pushed Fjona into the forge.  When Braxinus witnessed
this, he became so enraged that he slew the orcs to a single soul.  He told
this orc that he should tell all his people that their death was coming for
them.  After he burried Fjona, and burned the orc bodies, he set to work on
his last projects.  He re-forged the rings into 2 clasps to hold his now
braided beard.  He then forged one great axe, bearing the symbols of a
broken anvil and an orc's head.  After these were done, he declared that he
would change his name to Brax (in mockery of the orcs tendancy towards short
names) Darkforge.  He has never lit a forge fire since.  He spent the rest
of his mortal days slaying orcs and their kin.  His name became one to fear
in Bhaaltung, and they gave him the name Brax One-Eye "Orcsbane".  He killed
over 1000 orcs, single-handedly, before he died.  On the day he died, Brax
was overwhelmed by an ambush of nearly 200 orcs.  He was slaughtered after
taking well over 80 of their number.  When his soul left his body, it
created such a ripple in the after-life that the gods witnessed it.  They
decided to reward Brax for his many great deeds and made him a god.

1 NOTEBOARD~
A noteboard works in the same way as the mud-wide note system, with only
a few differences.  When you are in a room with a note board, the only notes
you will be reading or writing will be to that noteboard.  This means you
have to be in the same room as the noteboard to post to it, or to read from
it.

Quibe'Nar Forest, where the elves prefer to dwell.  The capitol is Zynil,
which is a large city growing on the outskirts of the forest.  The Quibe'Nar
Forest has been known as The Outpost.  It's the furthest this continent has
been explored, due to the extreme climates and icy waters to its northwest. 
Nobody has been able to travel far beyond the comfort of the trees.  
~
1 BHAALTUNG~
Bhaaltung is a kingdom peopled by orcs, ogres, trolls, and the like.

awakening, to replenish their stock.  With a hold in the northern Agradoss
Mountains, this massive alliance of evil tribes will most definately be a
force to reckon with.  The capitol is Gothspyll, a hold built into the
Agradoss Mountains.  The tribes gather here to unite and plan raiding and
long term missions, against other kingdoms.  
~

holds a massive desert population.  Pyramids rise and each family has their
own miniature pyramid, as a dwelling for both "lives" they will live.  
~
1 AATHAZAR~
Aathazar is a kingdom mainly made up of humans and elders.  They are an
honorable kingdom aiding the less fortunate as much as possible.  Lying in
and around the Jitari Mountains, this kingdom stands within striking
distance of the now evil Titre'Nir.  As one of the old allies of the
Elestrians, Aathatzar holds much political power in the world.  The capitol
city is Taytrow, which is a large walled city, holding a massive population
and is completely self reliant.  
~
1 TITRE'NIR~
Titre'Nir awoke undead.  It is believed that a clan of vampires were able
to breach the protections Titre'Nir set before the Lightbringer.  Now in the
Awakening, this once good nation awakes as a dark and torturous power.  Many
envoys from many kingdoms have travelled to this kingdom, since the
Awakening began, only to never return again.

is also the home of the Sacred Life Tree.  Elestria lies straight south of
Qu'Amir, about four hundred miles, on an island that ripped away from the

powerful magically petrified walls.

201 BOMBS~
creating bombs is easy
set the item type to bomb
value0 is unused so far, but is being saved
value1 is bomb type
0 explosive
1 napalm
2 chemical
value2 is the blast radius of the bomb, for example
a blast radius of 2 would result in all the rooms 1 room
away from the first room to behit by the explosion.
value3 is the bomb rating, damage is determined from
this rating, so don't go overboard.
a typical rating would be somewhere between 50 and 150 for a
normal handgrenade. a bigger bomb woul dbe more around 300,
however, something like 500 could get WAY out of hand.
500 * 8 damage for a max in some cases. owie.
waaaay owie. this would kill most players on the spot, even
though most times damage is not going to be at the max range
but still... it can happen.

1 THE KEEPERS~
You find yourself alone in a dark alley, all around the shadows climbing
their way up the walls like serpents fashioned of pure darkness. You turn
and begin to walk away thinking what you have been seeking nothing more
than rumour and hersey but before you can leave the cold embrace of the
shadows a figure moves with blinding speed, so quickly your eyes cannot
even begin to follow. Thats when you feel the sharp point of a blade upon
your throat and a hand across your mouth.
 
  "My name you may one day know...or perhaps not...names are meaningless.
  You asked to speak with us, and rather loudly at that. However, you 
  will not speak, rather you will listen. I do not promise that you will
  walk out of this alley alive this night, and even if I did do so, I am 
  not very good with promises. Listen now to what I say, and then perhaps 
     you will be permitted to speak.
 
  In a world of light, there will always be a darkness. In the world we
  know as Aethos, there will always be The Keepers. While kings and queens,
  warriors of repute, and knights strut about the lands loudmouthed in 
  their boasting, we keep to the shadows and move as ghosts. For what we 
  do is done in silence, such is the reason for our success. We claim to 
  be the true power of Aethos, many of those who do our bidding are not 
  even aware of our existence.
 
  Through constant manipulation and well-plotted deception we achieve our 
  goals.  Pride...pride has no place in The Keepers, for pride will kill you 
  as surely as any sword will. Pride leads to a short temper, and a short      
  temper leads to miscalculation. Timing in key...patience is to be studied.
  Do you belong in our ranks? If you must ask yourself this question, 
  then you probably do not. Few have a heart black enough, a soul depraved   
  enough, a mentality twisted enough to be The Keepers. We are the silent       
  killer, the one that is unexpected, quick, and ruthless. Our names are 
  no more than rumors, our plots known only to ourselves.
 
 
 
     So now you wish to know our requirements? We are not like the other
     clans my poor misguided youth. Our requirements are ours to know. 
     You have already become our servant by making your intentions known.     
     Whether you join us or not you will be of the same value in all 
     likeliness.
     Write a letter, if you can write that is, to The Keepers and say what
     you feel should be said. We will listen, and we will watch..."
     And with those words spoken you find yourself again alone. A shiver 
     runs down your spine...what have you done? Are you truly prepared for 
     what you seek? And what are the consequences of choosing such a fate?
